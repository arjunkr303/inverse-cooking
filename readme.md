# 🍽️ Inverse Cooking: Recipe Generation from Food Images
> A deep learning project that generates cooking recipes from food images using CNN and Transformer architecture.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project implements an **image-to-text generation model** that can look at a food image and generate step-by-step cooking instructions. Built with PyTorch, it combines a CNN encoder (ResNet18) for visual feature extraction and a Transformer decoder for sequential text generation.

### Key Features
- 🖼️ **Image Understanding**: Uses pre-trained ResNet18 to extract visual features
- 📝 **Recipe Generation**: Transformer decoder generates coherent cooking instructions
- 🎯 **End-to-End Training**: Single pipeline from image input to text output
- 📊 **13,463 Recipes**: Trained on diverse food dataset with real recipes
- ⚡ **GPU Optimized**: Efficient training with CUDA support

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Given an image of a finished dish, automatically generate the cooking recipe.

**Why It Matters**:
- Helps home cooks recreate dishes they see
- Assists people with dietary restrictions in understanding ingredients
- Educational tool for culinary students
- Accessibility feature for recipe discovery

## 📦 Model Files

> **Note**: Due to GitHub's file size limitations (100 MB max), the pre-trained model weights are hosted on Google Drive.

### Download Pre-trained Models

**Option 1: Automatic Download (Recommended)**
```bash
python download_model.py
```

**Option 2: Manual Download**

Download the following files and place them in the project root directory:

| File | Size | Description | Download Link |
|------|------|-------------|---------------|
| `best_model.pth` | 118 MB | Best checkpoint model | [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HfSb-zVBlxTf22YrheEVGbT7KjZHoe-C/view?usp=sharing) |
| `vocab.pkl` | <1 MB | Vocabulary object | [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13S6BM-Fc5uPCO-Tn1VJxxUnx3U0zFlHD/view?usp=sharing) |

**After downloading, your project structure should look like:**
```
inverse-cooking/
├── best_model.pth                ✅
├── vocab.pkl                     ✅
├── inverse-cooking.py
├── download_model.py
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

### Alternative: Train Your Own Models

If you prefer to train from scratch instead of using pre-trained weights, you can run the training script:
```bash
python inverse-cooking.py
```

Training takes approximately 1 hour on Tesla T4 GPU and use kaggle or colab for the T4 GPU.

## 💻 Usage

### Quick Inference

```python
from app import load_model, generate_recipe
from PIL import Image

# Load trained model and vocabulary
model, vocab, device = load_model()

# Generate recipe from image
image = Image.open('your_image.jpg')
recipe = generate_recipe(image, model, vocab, device)
print(recipe)
```
